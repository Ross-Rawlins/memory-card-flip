# Project Improvements

## Architectural Changes

### Log Management
- Implement dedicated collection for game logs to optimize query performance
- Create database triggers on the logs collection to automatically update game state
- This separation allows for better scalability and faster state lookups

### Error Handling
- Implement centralized error handling system
- Configure automated notifications via:
  - Email alerts to development team
  - Integration with social channels for developer notifications
- This ensures consistent error management and immediate team awareness of issues

### Real-time Updates
- Convert state checker to WebSocket implementation
- Enables real-time game state updates to clients
- Improves performance by reducing polling overhead

## Development Improvements

### Code Quality
- Integrate Prettier for consistent code formatting across the project
- Enhance TypeScript configuration with stricter rules as needed
- Benefits include:
  - Standardized code style
  - Reduced merge conflicts
  - Better type safety
  - Improved maintainability

### Code Organization
- Refactor controller logic into separate files
- Improved modularity and maintainability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing and debugging

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up Prettier:
```bash
npm install --save-dev prettier
```

3. Configure TypeScript rules in `tsconfig.json`

4. Update WebSocket implementation for state checking

5. Set up error notification channels
